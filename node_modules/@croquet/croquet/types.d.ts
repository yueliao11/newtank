     * Models are synchronized objects in Croquet.
     *
     * They are automatically kept in sync for each user in the same [session]{@link Session.join}.
     * Models receive input by [subscribing]{@link Model#subscribe} to events published in a {@link View}.
     * Their output is handled by views subscribing to events [published]{@link Model#publish} by a model.
     * Models advance time by sending messages into their [future]{@link Model#future}.
     *
     * ## Instance Creation and Initialization
     *
     * ### Do __NOT__ create a {@link Model} instance using `new` and<br>do __NOT__ override the `constructor`!
     *
     * To __create__ a new instance, use [create()]{@link Model.create}, for example:
     * ```
     * this.foo = FooModel.create({answer: 123});
     * ```
     * To __initialize__ an instance, override [init()]{@link Model#init}, for example:
     * ```
     * class FooModel extends Croquet.Model {
     *     init(options={}) {
     *         this.answer = options.answer || 42;
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     * The **reason** for this is that Models are only initialized by calling `init()`
     * the first time the object comes into existence in the session.
     * After that, when joining a session, the models are deserialized from the snapshot, which
     * restores all properties automatically without calling `init()`. A constructor would
     * be called all the time, not just when starting a session.
     *

         * The Croquet snapshot mechanism only knows about {@link Model} subclasses.
         * If you want to store instances of non-model classes in your model, override this method.
         *
         * `types()` needs to return an Object that maps _names_ to _class descriptions_:
         * - the name can be any string, it just has to be unique within your app
         * - the class description can either be just the class itself (if the serializer should
         *   snapshot all its fields, see first example below), or an object with `write()` and `read()` methods to
         *   convert instances from and to their serializable form (see second example below).
         * - the serialized form answered by `write()` can be almost anything. E.g. if it answers an Array of objects
         *   then the serializer will be called for each of those objects. Conversely, these objects will be deserialized
         *   before passing the Array to `read()`.
         *
         * The types only need to be declared once, even if several different Model subclasses are using them.
         *
         * __NOTE:__ This is currently the only way to customize serialization (for example to keep snapshots fast and small).
         * The serialization of Model subclasses themselves can not be customized.
         *
         * Example: To use the default serializer just declare the class:</caption>
         * ```
         * class MyModel extends Croquet.Model {
         *   static types() {
         *     return {
         *       "SomeUniqueName": MyNonModelClass,
         *       "THREE.Vector3": THREE.Vector3,        // serialized as '{"x":...,"y":...,"z":...}'

         *   }
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * Example: To define your own serializer, declare read and write functions:

         * class MyModel extends Croquet.Model {
         *   static types() {
         *     return {

        /**
         * **Register an event handler for an event published to a scope.**
         *
         * Both `scope` and `event` can be arbitrary strings.
         * Typically, the scope would select the object (or groups of objects) to respond to the event,
         * and the event name would select which operation to perform.
         *
         * A commonly used scope is `this.id` (in a model) and `model.id` (in a view) to establish
         * a communication channel between a model and its corresponding view.
         *
         * Unlike in a model's [subscribe]{@link Model#subscribe} method, you can specify when the event should be handled:
         * - **Queued:** The handler will be called on the next run of the [main loop]{@link Session.join},
         *   the same number of times this event was published.
         *   This is useful if you need each piece of data that was passed in each [publish]{@link Model#publish} call.
         *
         *   An example would be log entries generated in the model that the view is supposed to print.
         *   Even if more than one log event is published in one render frame, the view needs to receive each one.
         *
         *   **`{ event: "name", handling: "queued" }` is the default.  Simply specify `"name"` instead.**
         *
         * - **Once Per Frame:** The handler will be called only _once_ during the next run of the [main loop]{@link Session.join}.
         *   If [publish]{@link Model#publish} was called multiple times, the handler will only be invoked once,
         *   passing the data of only the last `publish` call.
         *
         *   For example, a view typically would only be interested in the current position of a model to render it.
         *   Since rendering only happens once per frame, it should subscribe using the `oncePerFrame` option.
         *   The event typically would be published only once per frame anyways, however,
         *   while the model is catching up when joining a session, this would be fired rapidly.
         *
         *   **`{ event: "name", handling: "oncePerFrame" }` is the most efficient option, you should use it whenever possible.**
         *
         * - **Immediate:** The handler will be invoked _synchronously_ during the [publish]{@link Model#publish} call.
         *   This will tie the view code very closely to the model simulation, which in general is undesirable.
         *   However, if the view needs to know the exact state of the model at the time the event was published,
         *   before execution in the model proceeds, then this is the facility to allow this without having to copy model state.
         *
         *   Pass `{event: "name", handling: "immediate"}` to enforce this behavior.
         *
         * The `handler` can be any callback function.
         * Unlike a model's [handler]{@link Model#subscribe} which must be a method of that model,
         * a view's handler can be any function, including fat-arrow functions declared in-line.
         * Passing a method like in the model is allowed too, it will be bound to `this` in the subscribe call.
         *
         * Example:
         * ```
         * this.subscribe("something", "changed", this.update);
         * this.subscribe(this.id, {event: "moved", handling: "oncePerFrame"}, pos => this.sceneObject.setPosition(pos.x, pos.y, pos.z));
